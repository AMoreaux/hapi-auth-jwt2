## Motivation

While making [***Time***](https://github.com/ideaq/time) we want to ensure
our app (and API) is as ***simple*** as *possible* to use.  
This lead us to using JSON Web Tokens for ***Stateless*** Authentication.

We did a *extensive* [research](https://www.npmjs.com/search?q=hapi+auth+jwt)
into *existing* modules that *might* solve our problem; there are *many* on NPM:
![npm search for hapi+jwt](http://i.imgur.com/xIj3Xpa.png)

but they invariably were ***way too complicated***, poorly documented and
had *useless* (non-real-world) "examples"!  
So we decided to write our own.

*Don't take our word for it, do your own homework and decide which module you prefer.*

### *Guiding Principal*

## Why hapi-auth-jwt2 ?

The name we wanted was taken.  
Think of our module as the "***new and simplified version***" :wink:
